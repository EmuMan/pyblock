# pyblock

A Python API wrapper for Hypixel's Skyblock API and more. Currently has very limited usage (see below)

## To-do

**Warning: This wrapper is far from finished and is subject to changes/reworks that may break certain functionality.**

- Finish models for everything that can be accessed through the API
- Add more wrapper functions to make complex operations easier
- Add ability to access specific items and their information (prices, recipes, etc.)
- Add support for API keys and key-exclusive functionality
- Potentially add support for asynchronous function calls
